Nothing amplifies success more than working in teams - a statement that I truly believe in! Looking at tennis and data analytics, three particularly important functions of teams can be observed: 

1. **Increased problem solving ability**: working on the same problem with a group of people increases the number of viewpoints that can be considered and thereby the chance to find a solution

2. **Support in difficult situations**: whether in tennis or data analytics, one repeatedly faces moments of frustration or demotivation, but in teams there is always someone to cheer you back up

3. **Faster learning**: since not all team members come from the same background, strengths and weaknesses are diversely distributed, which means that you can always learn something from others and vice versa

Whether it is on the the job, in the the classroom, or on the tennis court, I believe that a strong team spirit is essential to long-term success!
