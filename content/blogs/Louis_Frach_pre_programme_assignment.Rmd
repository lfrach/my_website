# A short introduction to Louis Frach \
Hello there! My name is **Louis** and originally I am from Hamburg, Germany. You can see a picture of my hometown below:

![The city's port is one of the biggest in Europe](https://images.musement.com/cover/0002/37/hamburg-landungsbrucken-less-jpg_header-136590.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=95&fit=crop)

Moving to London a few days ago marks the third time that I have moved abroad for studies. During high school, I moved to **Florida**, both to improve my English skills and to play competitive tennis. After high school, I then decided to attend the University of St. Gallen in **Switzerland**. Loving to ski makes Switzerland a great country to live in! After wrapping up my degree in business administration, I completed internships in private equity and most recently an early stage venture capital fund. At LBS, I am excited to meet motivated people, contribute to the *amazing* campus community and fully immerse myself in London!   

### Here are some more quick facts about me:
1. I have *3* siblings (two brothers and one sister)
2. Spain is my favorite vacation destination 
3. I am looking to join a VC firm after graduation

Now that you have some basic information on me, feel free to keep on exploring the site!
