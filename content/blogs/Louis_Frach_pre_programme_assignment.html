<p>Moving to London a few days ago marks the third time that I have moved abroad for studies. During high school, I moved to <strong>Florida</strong>, both to improve my English skills and to play competitive tennis. After high school, I then decided to attend the University of St. Gallen in <strong>Switzerland</strong>. Loving to ski makes Switzerland a great country to live in! After wrapping up my degree in business administration, I completed internships in private equity and most recently an early stage venture capital fund. At LBS, I am excited to meet motivated people, contribute to the <em>amazing</em> campus community and fully immerse myself in London!</p>
