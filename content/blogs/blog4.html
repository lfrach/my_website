<p>Nothing amplifies success more than working in teams - a statement that I truly believe in! Looking at tennis and data analytics, three particularly important functions of teams can be observed:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Increased problem solving ability</strong>: working on the same problem with a group of people increases the number of viewpoints that can be considered and thereby the chance to find a solution</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Support in difficult situations</strong>: whether in tennis or data analytics, one repeatedly faces moments of frustration or demotivation, but in teams there is always someone to cheer you back up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Faster learning</strong>: since not all team members come from the same background, strengths and weaknesses are diversely distributed, which means that you can always learn something from others and vice versa</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Whether it is on the the job, in the the classroom, or on the tennis court, I believe that a strong team spirit is essential to long-term success!</p>
