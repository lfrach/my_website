The second dimension to discuss is Technical Finesse. Again, no tennis player and no data analyst can be successful without a strong technical foundation. Hitting a backhand, like can be seen in the image, undoubtedly requires excellent technical skills. 


In the following, you can see an excerpt of my project on Hollywood directors and their ability to continuously produce highly-rated movies. Coming up with the confidence intervals for the plot requires a solid understanding of statistical analysis.  



```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(ggthemes)
library(GGally)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(broom)
library(tidyquant)

```




```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
```


```{r}
#summarising the relevant CI values for the two directors
two_directors<-movies %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) %>% 
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise(mean=mean(rating),
            sd=sd(rating),
            rating=mean(rating),
            count=n(),
            t_critical=qt(p=0.975, count-1),
            xmin=mean-t_critical*(sd/sqrt(count)),
            xmax=mean+t_critical*(sd/sqrt(count)))


#plotting the mean and confidence intervals, including the overlap
ggplot(two_directors, aes(x=rating, y=fct_reorder(director, rating)))+
  geom_line(aes(color=director))+
  geom_point(aes(color=director))+
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin=xmin, xmax=xmax, color=director), width=.1) +
  geom_rect(xmin=7.27, xmax=7.33, ymin=0, ymax=100, alpha=0.2)+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(mean, digits = 2)),vjust=-1)+
  geom_text(aes(x=xmin,label=round(xmin, digits = 2)),vjust=-1)+
  geom_text(aes(x=xmax,label=round(xmax, digits = 2)),vjust=-1)+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB rating?",
       subtitle = "95% confidence interval overlap",
       x = "Mean IMDB Rating", 
       y="",
       legend = "Director")
